# Python programming tutorial

This is a concise Python 3 programming tutorial for people who think
that reading is boring. I try to show everything with simple code
examples; there are no long and complicated explanations with fancy
words. If you have never programmed before click
[here](basics/what-is-programming.md) to find out what programming is
like and get started.

This tutorial is aimed at people with no programming experience at all
or very little programming experience. If you have programmed a lot in
the past using some other language you may want to read [the official
tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) instead.

You can use Python 3.3 or any newer Python with this tutorial. **Don't
use Python 2.** If you write a Python 2 program now someone will need to
convert it to Python 3 later, so it's best to just write Python 3 to
begin with. Python 3 code will work just fine in Python 4, so you don't
need to worry about that. Python 2 also has horrible
[Unicode](http://www.unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html) problems,
so it's difficult to write Python 2 code that works correctly with
non-English characters (like π and ♫).

## List of contents

The tutorial consists of two sections:

### Basics

This section will get you started with using Python and you'll be able
to learn more about whatever you want after studying it.

1. [What is programming?](basics/001-what-is-programming.md)
2. [Installing Python](basics/002-installing-python.md)
3. [Getting started with Python](basics/003-getting-started.md)
4. [ThinkPython: The way of the program](basics/004-the-way-of-the-program.md)
5. [Variables, Booleans and None](basics/005-variables.md)
6. [Using functions](basics/006-using-functions.md)
7. [Setting up an editor](basics/007-editor-setup.md)

### Advanced

If you want to learn more advanced techniques, you can also read this
section. Most of the techniques explained here are great when you're
working on a large project, and your code would be really repetitive
without these things.

You can experiment with these things freely, but please **don't use these
techniques just because you know how to use them.** Prefer the simple
techniques from the Basics part instead when possible. Simple is better
than complex.

1. [Handy data types](advanced/001-datatypes.md)
2. [Advanced stuff with functions](advanced/002-functions.md)
3. [Magic methods](advanced/003-magicmethods.md)
4. [Iterables, iterators and generators](advanced/004-iters.md)

### Other things this tutorial comes with

- Answers for excercises in [basics](basics/answers.md) and
    [advanced](advanced/answers.md) sections
- [The TODO list](TODO.md)
